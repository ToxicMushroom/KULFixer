# KULFixer

Reason for creations -> am lazy and fun experiment to see what's possible with android automation

Steps to use:
1. Install app using android studio or something
2. Open app
3. Click `SETTINGS` button and configure it
4. Click `GRANT PERMISSIONS` button to allow accessibility and notification stuff (if you have a weird brand that doesn't allow these permissions you're on your own)

Contributions for improvements and/or fixes are welcome.
If you want to add a feature please make an issue first.
